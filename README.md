## Project Overview

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page.
You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.
You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want.
The objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.
